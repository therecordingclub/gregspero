# Add New Releases and Project Transfer Guide

This plan covers adding Greg Spero's latest solo releases to the Music page and providing instructions for transferring the codebase to a different account.

## Proposed Changes

### Music Page
Update the `Latest Releases` section to include two new Spotify embeds above the current Spirit Fingers album.

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/gregspero/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/gregspero-com/src/app/music/page.tsx)
- Add embeds for:
    - **POP-OLOGY (EP, 2025)** - Spotify ID: `0gLBOn5Qq3BlzgyzF9SDcJ`
    - **Journeys (Album, 2025)** - Spotify ID: `3Zb8PNjZy5XU7XRzQXtgbL`
- Adjust spacing/layout if necessary to accommodate multiple players.

### Project Transfer (Manual Instructions)
I will provide the following guidance to the user in the final notification:

1. **Transferring Code via GitHub (Recommended)**:
   - Initialize a git repo: `git init`
   - Create a repository on GitHub.
   - Push the code: `git push origin main`
   - Log in with the other Google/GitHub account and clone it.
2. **Transferring Files Manually**:
   - Compress the project folder: `zip -r gregspero-com.zip .`
   - Move the zip file to the new account's environment.
3. **Google Cloud/Hosting Transfer**:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console > IAM & Admin.
   - Add the new email as an "Owner".

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Use the browser agent to load `http://localhost:3000/music` and verify that three Spotify players are now visible (POP-OLOGY, Journeys, and PEACE).

### Manual Verification
- User can verify the players load correctly and play the right music.
