# Walkthrough - GregSpero.com Rebuild

I have successfully rebuilt gregspero.com as a high-performance Next.js application with a premium, dark aesthetic.

## Changes
### Design System
- **Dark Mode Core**: Deep background (`#030305`) with neon accents (Purple/Blue).
- **Glassmorphism**: Used heavily in the Navbar and Content Cards for a modern feel.
- **Typography**: Paired `Outfit` (Headings) with `Inter` (Body) for a clean, tech-forward look.

### Components
- **Hero**: Full-screen gradient intro with entrance animations.
- **Bio**: Scroll-reveal biography highlighting Greg's dual career.
- **Projects**: Grid layout showcasing Spirit Fingers, Tiny Room, and weeBID.
- **Contact**: Simple, direct call-to-action with social links.

## Verification
- **Build**: Passed `npm run build` with no errors.
- **Responsiveness**: Layout uses `clamp()` and flex/grid to adapt to mobile and desktop.
