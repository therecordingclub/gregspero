# Walkthrough - Spirit Fingers Landing Page

I have successfully implemented the new **Spirit Fingers** landing page (`/spirit-fingers`), migrating the core experience from the original Wix site to the new Next.js application.

## Changes Created

### 1. New Page Component
- Created [src/app/spirit-fingers/page.tsx](file:///Users/gregspero/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/gregspero-com/src/app/spirit-fingers/page.tsx)
- Created [src/app/spirit-fingers/style.module.css](file:///Users/gregspero/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/gregspero-com/src/app/spirit-fingers/style.module.css)
- Implemented a responsive full-screen layout with a video background.

### 2. Assets
- Downloaded and optimized the original background video.
- Downloaded the high-quality Neon "SPIRIT FINGERS" logo.
- Downloaded the "PEACE" album art.

## Verification Results

### Automatic Verification
I used a browser agent to visit `http://localhost:3000/spirit-fingers` and programmatically verified the existence of key elements:
- ✅ **Video Background**: `<video>` tag found and playing.
- ✅ **Branding**: Neon logo image found.
- ✅ **CTA**: "Listen to PEACƎ" button found.

### Visual Verification
Below is a screenshot of the implemented page running locally:

## Next Steps
- The page is live locally.
- You can further customize the "Bio", "Tour", etc. links in the `SocialNav` component within the page.
