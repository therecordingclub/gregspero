# Music Page Implementation Plan

## Goal
Replace the single-project "Spirit Fingers" page with a comprehensive `/music` page that showcases Greg Spero's entire musical career, including his solo work, Spirit Fingers, collaborations (Halsey, Miles Electric Band), and The Recording Club (Tiny Room).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `/spirit-fingers` route will be replaced/redirected to `/music`. The homepage "Spirit Fingers" card will be updated to link to `/music`.

## Proposed Changes

### Components
#### [NEW] [MusicDashboard](file:///src/app/music/page.tsx)
A new page component at `src/app/music/page.tsx` featuring:
- **Hero Section**: "Greg Spero / Music" with a high-impact visual.
- **Listen Section**: Spotify Artist embed.
- **Projects Showcase**:
    - **Spirit Fingers**: Using the neon logo and video background assets (repurposed from the old page).
    - **Halsey**: Mentioning his 4-year tenure as sound designer/keyboardist.
    - **Miles Electric Band**: Highlighting his work with Miles Davis alumni.
    - **The Recording Club / Tiny Room**: Embedding the "The Tip" or "Find" videos.
- **Video Grid**: Selected YouTube embeds of top performances.

#### [NEW] [Styles](file:///src/app/music/style.module.css)
- Dark, premium aesthetic (consistent with the site).
- Grid layouts for videos and projects.

### Navigation
#### [MODIFY] [Projects.tsx](file:///src/components/Projects.tsx)
- Update the "Spirit Fingers" card.
- **Change**: Card title from "Spirit Fingers" to "Music" or "Discography"? 
    - *Decision*: Keep "Spirit Fingers" as a *highlight* distinct card? 
    - *Better*: Rename the "Spirit Fingers" card to "Original Music" or "Discography" and link to `/music`. Or keep "Spirit Fingers" but link to the Spirit Fingers *section* of the music page (`/music#spirit-fingers`).
    - *Refined Plan*: The user said "replace the Spirit Fingers page". I will change the link in [Projects.tsx](file:///Users/gregspero/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/gregspero-com/src/components/Projects.tsx) for the "Spirit Fingers" card to `/music` and potentially rename the title to "Music".

### Assets
- Reuse existing `neon-logo.png`, `peace-album.jpg`, `background.mp4`.
- may utilize external images for Halsey/Miles Electric if available via URL, or text descriptions if valid images aren't handy (checking via search/browser if needed, but text + styling is safer).

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Browser subagent to navigate to `/music`.
- Verify presence of sections: Spirit Fingers, Halsey, Miles Electric Band, Spotify Embed.
- Verify links work.

### Manual Verification
- Visual check of the layout and embeds.
