# Walkthrough - Music Page

I have replaced the individual Spirit Fingers page with a comprehensive **Music Page** (`/music`), showcasing Greg Spero's full range of work.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Unified Music Hub
- **URL**: `/music` (Replaces `/spirit-fingers`)
- **Structure**:
    - **Header**: "Greg Spero / Music"
    - **Listen**: Spotify Artist Embed
    - **Spirit Fingers**: Immersive section with video background and Neon logo.
    - **Collaborations**: Cards for **Halsey** and **Miles Electric Band**.
    - **The Recording Club**: Video grid featuring 4 Tiny Room sessions:
        1. "The Tip"
        2. "Find" (Spirit Fingers)
        3. "Inside" (Spirit Fingers)
        4. "Halloween" (Greg Spero & MonoNeon)

### 2. Navigation Updates
- Homepage "Spirit Fingers" card now links to `/music`.
- "Spirit Fingers" branding preserved within the new page section.
