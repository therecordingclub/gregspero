# Implementation Plan - Minimalist Refactor & Content Update

Refining the design to be more minimalist and replacing weeBID with Artist AI.

## User Review Required
- **Design Shift**: Moving away from heavy glassmorphism/neon to a cleaner, flatter, more typographic style.
- **Content Change**: Replacing "weeBID" with "Artist AI" (AI Artist Manager).

## Proposed Changes

### Design (src/app/globals.css)
- **Simplify Colors**: Reduce neon intensity. Use monochrome with subtle accents.
- **Remove Glass**: Replace `.glass` with simple borders or solid backgrounds.
- **Typography**: Increase whitespace, stick to strict hierarchy.

### Components
#### [MODIFY] [Bio.tsx](file:///Users/gregspero/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/gregspero-com/src/components/Bio.tsx)
- Update text to mention Artist AI instead of weeBID.

#### [MODIFY] [Projects.tsx](file:///Users/gregspero/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/gregspero-com/src/components/Projects.tsx)
- Replace "weeBID" card with "Artist AI".
- Description: "AI-powered artist management, streamlining logistics to empower creativity."

#### [MODIFY] [Hero.tsx](file:///Users/gregspero/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/gregspero-com/src/components/Hero.tsx)
- Clean up title animations and spacing.
- Ensure video overlay is subtle but effective for text readability.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Check "Artist AI" copy.
- Verify minimalist aesthetic (no clutter, clean lines).
